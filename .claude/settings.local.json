Understanding Convergence Tables:\n   - Detailed explanation of each column: N, h, DOF, L² error, L∞ error, H¹ error\n   - What convergence rates mean and how to read them\n   - Concrete example showing how to interpret a table row\n   - Expected values for different problem types\n\n2. Understanding Convergence Plots \\(4-panel explanation\\):\n   - Panel 1: L² error vs mesh size \\(log-log\\)\n     * How to read log-log plots\n     * What slopes indicate \\(convergence rates\\)\n     * Reference lines and their meaning\n     * What to look for: straight lines, relative positions, stagnation\n   \n   - Panel 2: Relative L² error vs mesh size\n     * Normalization and when it''s useful\n     * Interpreting relative error magnitudes\n   \n   - Panel 3: Error vs degrees of freedom \\(efficiency\\)\n     * Why this matters for comparing methods with different DOF\n     * How to determine which method is more efficient\n     * Accounting for 6× DOF difference between methods\n   \n   - Panel 4: Convergence rates over refinements\n     * What rate consistency means\n     * Interpreting increasing/decreasing/oscillating rates\n     * Expected values and what deviations indicate\n\n3. Comparing Polynomial vs Rational Methods:\n   - Framework for systematic comparison\n   - Four key questions to ask when comparing results\n   - How to test the \"coarse mesh hypothesis\"\n\n4. Special Considerations:\n   - Discontinuous problems: why rates are limited\n   - Near-pole problems: where rationals should excel\n   - Oscillatory problems: resolution requirements\n\nThe guide provides readers with a complete framework for understanding\nthe numerical results and making informed decisions about which approximation\nmethod to use for their specific problem.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")"
